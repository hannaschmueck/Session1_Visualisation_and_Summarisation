        "setting up the SpaCy natural language processing (NLP) library to perform various linguistic tasks such as tokenization, parsing, and named entity recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Importing Modules**:\n",
        "   Before using SpaCy's functionalities, you first need to import the necessary components. The `Tokenizer` class is specifically imported to handle the tokenization process.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from spacy.tokenizer import Tokenizer\n",
        "   import spacy\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loading the SpaCy Model**:\n",
        "   The SpaCy model for English (`en_core_web_sm`) is loaded using `spacy.load()`. This model includes data and algorithms necessary for language processing tasks. If you're processing text in another language, you would load the corresponding model (e.g., `de_core_news_sm` for German).\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")  # loading language model\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This model loading step is crucial because it prepares SpaCy with the tools and data needed for processing English text, including pre-trained weights for understanding the structure and meaning of the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Alternative Model Importing Method**:\n",
        "   The commented-out lines provide an alternative way to load the SpaCy model. This method involves directly importing the model package and calling the `load()` method on it, which is useful if you want to avoid using the string name and prefer a more explicit import statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   #import en_core_web_sm\n",
        "   #nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Tokenizer Initialization**:\n",
        "   After loading the language model, a `Tokenizer` object is created using the vocabulary from the loaded `nlp` object. This tokenizer is configured to split text into tokens using the vocabulary of the English model.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   tokenizer = Tokenizer(nlp.vocab)  # Create a blank Tokenizer with just the English vocab\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Note on Errors:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **tokenisation**: The primary operation is the tokenisation of the `sentence`. tokenisation is a process that splits the text into individual elements or \"tokens,\" which are typically words or significant punctuation marks. This is crucial for many NLP tasks as it converts unstructured text into a structured form that algorithms can work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here, it's important to note that the tokenisation is sensitive to punctuation. This means punctuation like the Arabic comma '،' is recognised and treated as a separate token, which can be vital for language-specific processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Token Count**: After tokenisation, the code calculates and prints the number of tokens in the sentence. This metric is useful for understanding the size of the data being processed, which can impact both performance and the approach to further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   print('Number of words: ', len(tokens))\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",

The result is a `Doc` object that contains a sequence of token objects.\n",
